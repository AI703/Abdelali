# AbdelaliBot

AbdelaliBot(@Devsync_bot) is a telegram bot that allows individuals to provide software idea recommendations, which reaches many developers. You won't have to worry about using freelancing websites or using subreddits(these also reaches only developers within that subreddit) Devsync will allow you to communicate with many developers throughout many platforms e.g. slack, discord, telegram, IRC, etc.

Developers will also have accounts, and will be able to login and check their messages, etc. as so will the individuals sending the app ideas.

The Mobile application version of AbdelaliBot is coming soon.

(Bot is still being developed)

# Abdelali Features:
- Discord third party use, Developers will be able to connect their Discord bot to AbdelaliBot and use the Abdelali features.
- Programming Q&A, Abdelali will be able to answer questions relating to programming
- Abdelali will rate your app idea.

# Note
This project is based on the assumption that you are providing ideas because you just want to help the community and not because you want profit, however if you want profit from your app idea then all you have to do is donate 10$(USD)
